# Perplexity Search

## Overview

Perform AI-powered web searches using Perplexity models through LiteLLM and OpenRouter. Perplexity provides real-time, web-grounded answers with source citations, making it ideal for finding current information, recent scientific literature, and facts beyond the model's training data cutoff.

This skill provides access to all Perplexity models through OpenRouter, requiring only a single API key (no separate Perplexity account needed).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Searching for current information or recent developments (2024 and beyond)
- Finding latest scientific publications and research
- Getting real-time answers grounded in web sources
- Verifying facts with source citations
- Conducting literature searches across multiple domains
- Accessing information beyond the model's knowledge cutoff
- Performing domain-specific research (biomedical, technical, clinical)
- Comparing current approaches or technologies

**Do not use** for:
- Simple calculations or logic problems (use directly)
- Tasks requiring code execution (use standard tools)
- Questions well within the model's training data (unless verification needed)

## Quick Start

### Setup (One-time)

1. **Get OpenRouter API key**:
   - Visit https://openrouter.ai/keys
   - Create account and generate API key
   - Add credits to account (minimum $5 recommended)

2. **Configure environment**:

3. **Install dependencies**:

4. **Verify setup**:

### Basic Usage

**Simple search:**

**Save results:**

**Use specific model:**


**Verbose output:**

## Available Models

Access models via `--model` parameter:

- **sonar-pro** (default): General-purpose search, best balance of cost and quality
- **sonar-pro-search**: Most advanced agentic search with multi-step reasoning
- **sonar**: Basic model, most cost-effective for simple queries
- **sonar-reasoning-pro**: Advanced reasoning with step-by-step analysis
- **sonar-reasoning**: Basic reasoning capabilities

**Model selection guide:**
- Default queries → `sonar-pro`
- Complex multi-step analysis → `sonar-pro-search`
- Explicit reasoning needed → `sonar-reasoning-pro`
- Simple fact lookups → `sonar`
- Cost-sensitive bulk queries → `sonar`

## Crafting Effective Queries

### Be Specific and Detailed

**Good examples:**
- "What are the latest clinical trial results for CAR-T cell therapy in treating B-cell lymphoma published in 2024?"
- "Compare the efficacy and safety profiles of mRNA vaccines versus viral vector vaccines for COVID-19"
- "Explain AlphaFold3 improvements over AlphaFold2 with specific accuracy metrics from 2023-2024 research"

**Bad examples:**
- "Tell me about cancer treatment" (too broad)
- "CRISPR" (too vague)
- "vaccines" (lacks specificity)

### Include Time Constraints

Perplexity searches real-time web data:
- "What papers were published in Nature Medicine in 2024 about long COVID?"
- "What are the latest developments (past 6 months) in large language model efficiency?"
- "What was announced at NeurIPS 2023 regarding AI safety?"

### Specify Domain and Sources

For high-quality results, mention source preferences:
- "According to peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals..."
- "Based on FDA-approved treatments..."
- "From clinical trial registries like clinicaltrials.gov..."

### Structure Complex Queries

Break complex questions into clear components:
1. **Topic**: Main subject
2. **Scope**: Specific aspect of interest
3. **Context**: Time frame, domain, constraints
4. **Output**: Desired format or type of answer

**Example:**
"What improvements does AlphaFold3 offer over AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction, according to research published between 2023 and 2024? Include specific accuracy metrics and benchmarks."

## Common Use Cases

### Scientific Literature Search

### Technical Documentation

### Comparative Analysis


### Clinical Research


### Trend Analysis


## Working with Results

### Programmatic Access


### Save and Process Results


### Batch Processing

Create a script for multiple queries.


## Cost Management

Perplexity models have different pricing tiers:

**Approximate costs per query:**
- Sonar: $0.001-0.002 (most cost-effective)
- Sonar Pro: $0.002-0.005 (recommended default)
- Sonar Reasoning Pro: $0.005-0.010
- Sonar Pro Search: $0.020-0.050+ (most comprehensive)

**Cost optimization strategies:**
1. Use `sonar` for simple fact lookups
2. Default to `sonar-pro` for most queries
3. Reserve `sonar-pro-search` for complex analysis
4. Set `--max-tokens` to limit response length
5. Monitor usage at https://openrouter.ai/activity
6. Set spending limits in OpenRouter dashboard

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill complements other scientific skills:

### Literature Review

Use with `literature-review` skill:
1. Use Perplexity to find recent papers and preprints
2. Supplement PubMed searches with real-time web results
3. Verify citations and find related work
4. Discover latest developments post-database indexing

### Scientific Writing

Use with `scientific-writing` skill:
1. Find recent references for introduction/discussion
2. Verify current state of the art
3. Check latest terminology and conventions
4. Identify recent competing approaches

### Hypothesis Generation

Use with `hypothesis-generation` skill:
1. Search for latest research findings
2. Identify current gaps in knowledge
3. Find recent methodological advances
4. Discover emerging research directions

### Critical Thinking

Use with `scientific-critical-thinking` skill:
1. Find evidence for and against hypotheses
2. Locate methodological critiques
3. Identify controversies in the field
4. Verify claims with current evidence

## Best Practices

### Query Design

1. **Be specific**: Include domain, time frame, and constraints
2. **Use terminology**: Domain-appropriate keywords and phrases
3. **Specify sources**: Mention preferred publication types or journals
4. **Structure questions**: Clear components with explicit context
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on initial results

### Model Selection

1. **Start with sonar-pro**: Good default for most queries
2. **Upgrade for complexity**: Use sonar-pro-search for multi-step analysis
3. **Downgrade for simplicity**: Use sonar for basic facts
4. **Use reasoning models**: When step-by-step analysis needed

### Cost Optimization

1. **Choose appropriate models**: Match model to query complexity
2. **Set token limits**: Use `--max-tokens` to control costs
3. **Monitor usage**: Check OpenRouter dashboard regularly
4. **Batch efficiently**: Combine related simple queries when possible
5. **Cache results**: Save and reuse results for repeated queries

### Security

1. **Protect API keys**: Never commit to version control
2. **Use environment variables**: Keep keys separate from code
3. **Set spending limits**: Configure in OpenRouter dashboard
4. **Monitor usage**: Watch for unexpected activity
5. **Rotate keys**: Change keys periodically
